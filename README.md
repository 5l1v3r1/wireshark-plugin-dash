# Wireshark dissector plugin for the [Dash](https://www.dash.org/) cryptocurrency protocol
A Dash protocol dissector converted from the bitcoin built-in dissector and updated to include Dash specific commands (based on [outdated protocol documentation](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/master/dash-docs/protocol-documentation.md) and [source code](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/blob/master/src/protocol.cpp)).
